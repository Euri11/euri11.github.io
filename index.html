    <p>The Buddha perceives through meditative vision that Aṅgulimāla has slain 999 victims, and is desperately seeking a thousandth. If the Buddha is to encounter Aṅgulimāla that day, the latter will become a monk and subsequently attain abhiññā. However, if Aṅgulimāla is to kill his mother instead, she will be his thousandth victim and he will be unsavable,since matricide in Buddhism is considered one of the five worst actions a person can commit.</p>

                    <p class="t1">But then when the Buddha also arrives, he chooses to kill him instead of her mother. He draws his sword, and starts running towards the Buddha. But although Aṅgulimāla is running as fast as he can, he cannot catch up with the Buddha who is walking calmly. This bewilders Aṅgulimāla so much that he calls to the Buddha to stop. The Buddha then says that he himself has already stopped, and that it is Aṅgulimāla who should stop.</p>

Aṅgulimāla is impressed by the Buddha's courage, and struck with guilt about what he has done. After listening to the Buddha, Aṅgulimāla reverently declares himself converted, vows to cease his life as a brigand and joins the Buddhist monastic order. He is admitted in the Jetavana monastery.</p>
