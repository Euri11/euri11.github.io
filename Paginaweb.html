        <h1>Aṅgulimāla</h1>
        <br />
        <p>The Buddha perceives through meditative vision that Aṅgulimāla has slain 999 victims, and is desperately seeking a thousandth. If the Buddha is to encounter Aṅgulimāla that day, the latter will become a monk and subsequently attain abhiññā. However, if Aṅgulimāla is to kill his mother instead, she will be his thousandth victim and he will be unsavable,since matricide in Buddhism is considered one of the five worst actions a person can commit.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The Buddha sets off to intercept Aṅgulimāla, despite being warned by local villagers not to go. On the road through the forest of Kosala, Aṅgulimāla first sees his mother. According to some versions of the story, he then has a moment of reconciliation with her, she providing food for him. After some deliberation, however, he decides to make her his thousandth victim. But then when the Buddha also arrives, he chooses to kill him instead. He draws his sword, and starts running towards the Buddha. But although Aṅgulimāla is running as fast as he can, he cannot catch up with the Buddha who is walking calmly. The Buddha is using some supernatural accomplishment that affects Aṅgulimāla: one text states the Buddha through these powers contracts and expands the earth on which they stand, thus keeping a distance of Aṅgulimāla. This bewilders Aṅgulimāla so much that he calls to the Buddha to stop. The Buddha then says that he himself has already stopped, and that it is Aṅgulimāla who should stop.</p>
        <br />
        <p style="font-style:italic;">I, Angulimala, am standing still, having for all beings laid aside the rod; but you are unrestrained regarding creatures; therefore, I am standing still, you are not standing still.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Aṅgulimāla asks for further explanation, after which the Buddha says that a good monk should control his desires. Aṅgulimāla is impressed by the Buddha's courage, and struck with guilt about what he has done. After listening to the Buddha, Aṅgulimāla reverently declares himself converted, vows to cease his life as a brigand and joins the Buddhist monastic order. He is admitted in the Jetavana monastery.</p>
